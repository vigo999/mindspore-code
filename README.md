# MindSpore Model Agent

MindSpore Model Agent is a training-focused AI agent solution for the MindSpore ecosystem. It is designed for the high-frequency engineering work around model training, where users need more than general code generation and need help with domain-specific training tasks.

It is built on two closely related parts:

- `mindspore-skills`: the domain capability layer for model training and debugging tasks. It provides reusable skills for readiness checking, failure diagnosis, accuracy analysis, performance analysis, model migration, algorithm adaptation, and operator implementation. These skills can work not only with MindSpore Model Agent, but also with other agentic CLI environments such as Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex.
- `mindspore-cli`: the official CLI of MindSpore Model Agent. It provides better integration with related skills and is optimized for model training use cases, offering a more unified end-to-end experience for training-oriented workflows.

## What's New in v0.1.0

- Initial public release of MindSpore Model Agent
- Introduced `mindspore-skills` as the reusable capability layer for model training and debugging tasks
- Introduced `mindspore-cli` as the official CLI optimized for model training workflows

## MindSpore CLI

MindSpore CLI is the official end-to-end interface of MindSpore Model Agent. It is designed to provide a unified CLI experience for training-oriented workflows, with tighter integration with the related skills behind the solution.

## Installation

### Install from script

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mindspore-lab/mindspore-cli/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Build from source

Go 1.24.2+:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindspore-cli.git
cd mindspore-cli
go build -o mscli ./cmd/mscli
./mscli
```

## Quick Start

### Use the free built-in model

```bash
mscli
# Choose "mscli-provided" → "kimi-k2.5 [free]" on first run
```

### Bring your own API key

```bash
export MSCLI_API_KEY=sk-...
export MSCLI_MODEL=deepseek-chat
mscli
```

### Use OpenAI / Anthropic / OpenRouter

```bash
# OpenAI
export MSCLI_PROVIDER=openai-completion
export MSCLI_API_KEY=sk-...
export MSCLI_MODEL=gpt-4o

# Anthropic
export MSCLI_PROVIDER=anthropic
export MSCLI_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export MSCLI_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514

# OpenRouter
export MSCLI_PROVIDER=openai-completion
export MSCLI_API_KEY=sk-or-...
export MSCLI_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1

mscli
```
